# 3D-Printed Rocket Nozzle
Design for a convergent-diverget nozzle using thrust optimized profile (TOP) bell geometry. Designed to be a drop-in replacement on our current generation hybrid rocket to drastically reduce weight and maintenance required on the nozzle. 

Most of the work I've been doing is in simulation using transient thermal studies in ANSYS as well as comustion products modelling in Rocket Propulsion Analysis (RPA). Based on efficiency studies, the nozzle will be designed to hit a 4.2 area ratio of expansion and a chamber pressure of 450psig at an oxidizer/fuel ratio of 4.7.
Transient thermal simulation was done in ANSYS using convection properties of the engine exhaust gases to confirm the maximum temperature is within the limits of the materials used.

We are currently establishing design options for thermal control mechanisms (ablative nozzle liners, ceramic throat inserts, active nozzle cooling or heat sinks). The flame temperature of our combustion is a cool 3000K which makes this a very interesting problem.
