Built as a 1B term project, this helium blimp sucessfully flew at the March 2016 UWaterloo open house. I was primairily involved with the design and construction of the lifting bag which was constructed out of a heat-sealed mylar sheet.

It was able to make turns and stay aloft for a good amount of time before losing too much helium. The control was accomplished using a Mindstorms NXT running robotC due to class requirements.
