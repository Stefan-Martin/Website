**Automated reliability testing rig**
![rig](../assets/img/ReliabilityJig.jpg)
Designed to repeatedly cycle the mehanical interlocks present on a craninal MRI. The control was accomplished using an Arduino with limit switches to check the function of the systems under test at every cycle. The linear stage was driven using a clearpath brushless servo via a belt drive.

The setup sucessfully ran over 20,000 cycles and featured error logging and a LCD screen to display error codes if any test failures were observed.
