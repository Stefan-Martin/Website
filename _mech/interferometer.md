Capstone project which I am currently working on which aims to use the method of [self-mixing interferometry](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228559944_Laser_diode_self-mixing_technique_for_sensing_applications) to make sub-micron measurments with ~$100 dollars in equipment. I am working on a team to develop the optics and hardware required to turn this research topic into a commercial system. 

Applications include:
1. Precision Motion Control
2. Vibration Measurement
3. Surface Roughness Measurment
4. Profilometry
5. Non-contact Velocimetry

A proof of concept was required to ensure that we were able to see signal at all and so one was hasitly constructed using a scope and a simple linear stage with a retroreflector.
