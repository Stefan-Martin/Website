**Guy-Manuel Helmet 3d printed entirely on the Form2**


![Guy-manuel](assets/img/DaftPunk.jpg)
Printed in 5 pieces out of merged STL files in grey Pro on the F2. Total print time was in excess of 100 hours.

The visor was thermoformed out of 1.5mm PETG using a 3D printed mould. I will hopefully get around to tinting it soon.
